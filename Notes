- facial recognition

Things we need
- need Windows 8.1 (and visual studio?)
- visual studio
- open cv (Must Use 2.4.9!!!)
+ make sure you set the path for this to work
- eyetribe sdk
- Kinect sdk C#




Setup
- make sure FaceBasics is bolded (select it and project > set as startup ...)

FaceBasics: main (pulls data from the Kinect)
 - pulls frames from Kinect -> to openCV
FaceEnrollment: 
 - openCV -> adapted for Kinect
 - does the training
 - 

 FaceRecognition
 - FaceRecognition.h: wrapper for bridging Kinect (C#) to OpenCV (C++)
 
 - Train (in FaceRecognition.cpp) array
 images: d.jpg, d.jpg, d.jpg, d.jpg
 labels: dylan, dylan, dylan, dylan
 crop: <x,y coordinates for where to crop>
 --> calls the OpenCV train
 FaceRecognitionResult: label (integer, needs to be mapped to database), confidence

=====================

Metro App

have keyboard come up when look at bottom

separate app WINDOWS APP!
kinect feed (video feed)
who is there

https://dev.windows.com/en-us/getstarted

What kind of information needs to be sent over network? 2 computers
- specify where to dump the file of data
- name, coordinate distance from kinect, in the future: bluetooth

master folder
- store images, id 

Repo for EyeHome?
Is the ocuhub online yet?

What is the separateion between the ocuhub and the separate 

OcuHub reads from a file on the desktop

TODO
- review videos of 118
- run hey you and see what can be done with it for Kinect App


Kinect App
- context.txt (write 'company' or 'alone')
- contacts.txt (people in the room) - (id, time they came in, distance)
- /<id>/
	+ info.txt (contains name, and later other details)
	+ 10 x <date><time>.jpg buffer
    	- 10 hertz (take face pics 10th of a second)

Messenger
- do windows app tutorial and make sure it resizes
- start with template (video feed and "in-room buddy list")


=> Try making my own based off of FaceBasics, ask Dylan how he did the openCV connecting

- training is done at the very beginning through the enrollment gui, then it opens up the video stream and "names" those people
- does not know if someone is a new person (will try to map to most similar person, lol)

====== Next Meeting

Hi everyone,

I just wanted to update you all on my progress with the Kinect and OpenCV.

I've been working with Frank from team 5 and we are finding the setup of their code to be difficult. We are getting a lot of errors on a clean install of their code and will probably need to work on this further with Dylan. It's hard to get schedules to work together, as well.

While removing the GUI and the EyeTribe portions of the code sounds easy, it is proving to be much harder than it sounds!

Cheers,
Angie
