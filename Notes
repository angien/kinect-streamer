- facial recognition

Things we need
- need Windows 8.1 (and visual studio?)
- visual studio
- open cv (Iâ€™m using 2.4)
- eyetribe sdk
- Kinect sdk C#

FaceBasics: main (pulls data from the Kinect)
 - pulls frames from Kinect -> to openCV
FaceEnrollment: 
 - openCV -> adapted for Kinect
 - does the training
 - 

 FaceRecognition
 - FaceRecognition.h: wrapper for bridging Kinect (C#) to OpenCV (C++)
 
 - Train (in FaceRecognition.cpp) array
 images: d.jpg, d.jpg, d.jpg, d.jpg
 labels: dylan, dylan, dylan, dylan
 crop: <x,y coordinates for where to crop>
 --> calls the OpenCV train
 FaceRecognitionResult: label (integer, needs to be mapped to database), confidence

=====================

Metro App

have keyboard come up when look at bottom

separate app WINDOWS APP!
kinect feed (video feed)
who is there

https://dev.windows.com/en-us/getstarted

What kind of information needs to be sent over network? 2 computers
- specify where to dump the file of data
- name, coordinate distance from kinect, in the future: bluetooth

master folder
- store images, id 

Repo for EyeHome?
Is the ocuhub online yet?

What is the separateion between the ocuhub and the separate 

OcuHub reads from a file on the desktop

TODO
- review videos of 118
- run hey you and see what can be done with it for Kinect App


Kinect App
- context.txt (write 'company' or 'alone')
- contacts.txt (people in the room) - (id, time they came in, distance)
- /<id>/
	+ info.txt (contains name, and later other details)
	+ 10 x <date><time>.jpg buffer
    	- 10 hertz (take face pics 10th of a second)

Messenger
- do windows app tutorial and make sure it resizes
- start with template (video feed and "in-room buddy list")
